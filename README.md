## HCI Paper ##
In this project I put some paper about interaction which I am very interested.

Most of the paper have been read and some of them are summarized in the document. 
In addition, some of the paper were attached my own view.

I divide them into several categories:
    
(1) [Tactile_Feedback_Screen](#)&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;(In this category articles are mainly foucus on "Tactile Feedback Screen". )  
    |        
    |--[Interaction_research](#)  
    |&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;(It focus on HCI in tactile feedback screen. Such as use the screen to improve driving,use experience,visually impaired...)  
    |--[Hardware manufacturing](#)   
    |&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;(Some paper about the hardware. )  
    |--[Others](#)    
    |&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;(Some paper about the HCI in phone,car,and so on. These articles have some connection with tactile feedback. )  
    |--[Important papers](#)  
    &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;(There are some paper which I think it is very important in tactile feedback screen. )  
  
  
  
(2) [VR_AR](#)&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;(In this category articles are mainly foucus on "Virtual Reality" and "Augmented Reality". )
