## HCI Paper ##
    In this project I put some paper about interaction which I am very interested.

    Most of the paper have been read and some of them are summarized in the document. 
    In addition, some of the paper were attached my own view.

    I divide them into several categories:
        
        (1) * Tactile_Feedback_Screen * [In this category articles are mainly foucus on "Tactile Feedback Screen". ]
            |-* Interaction_research * 
            |       [It focus on HCI in tactile feedback screen. Such as use the screen to improve driving,use experience,visually impaired...]
            |-* Hardware manufacturing * 
            |       [Some paper about the hardware. ]
            |-* Others * 
            |       [Some paper about the HCI in phone,car,and so on. These articles have some connection with tactile feedback. ]
            |-* Important papers * 
                    [There are some paper which I think it is very important in tactile feedback screen. ]




        (2) * VR_AR * [In this category articles are mainly foucus on "Virtual Reality" and "Augmented Reality". ]
