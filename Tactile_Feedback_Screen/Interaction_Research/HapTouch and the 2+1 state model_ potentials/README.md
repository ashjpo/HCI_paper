## E-Pad: A Comfortable Electrocutaneous-based Tactile Feedback Display ##

**Main Content:** A novel electrocutaneous-based tactile device with the name of E-pad is pro-posed to provide a dynamic and static low-voltage feedback for touchscreen. We optimize the key parameters of the output voltage and design custom-made hardwares to guarantee a comfortable user experience. Users could move their fingers freely across the touchscreen of the proposed device to really feel virtual objects.
